**Changelog:**

Huge new feature: **realistic rendering**!

When printing, select the "Realistic" checkbox to switch a preview image to realistic thread
rendering.  Note that rendering can take awhile, so don't be surprised if the view doesn't change for 10-20 seconds.  Gives equally good results in "print to PDF" or direct printing.  Realistic images are
rendered at 600dpi.
