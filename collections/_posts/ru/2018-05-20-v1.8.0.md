Please fully delete Ink/Stitch from your extensions directory before installing this version.
{: .notice--warning}

Ink/Stitch was previously a set of separate scripts, each implementing an extension in a one-to-one correspondence.  Now all of the extensions are implemented by a single python script.  This is an "under-the-hood" only change that should not have any noticeable effects.

There is one big visible improvement: the zip for Linux is one third of the previous size!
