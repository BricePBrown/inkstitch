title:  "Ink/Stitch v1.25.0: Electron for Print PDF UI"
date:   2019-05-02
categories: Releases

**Changelog:**

This version transitions Print PDF to use Electron, a bundled version of Chromium browser.  The Print PDF interface no longer opens in your default web browser.  This change shouldn't be particularly significant for most users.

This lays the groundwork for converting the rest of Ink/Stitch's GUI to use Electron, which will enable faster development and a more modern interface.

The Ink/Stitch installation ZIP/tarball is significantly bigger in this version.  Once we've finished the work of converting the existing interface to Electron, the ZIP/tarball will shrink.
