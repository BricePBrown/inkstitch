**Changelog:**
* add STOP commands as stand-alone stitches rather than attaching to an existing stitch
  * PES requires this, along with possibly other formats
  * fixes #170
* ignore "TRIM after" at the end of a color block
  * the machine will trim the thread anyway
* fixed two bugs in running stitch
  * the bugs:
    * the first stitch was duplicated
    * the last stitch was omitted
  * these bugs totally screwed up tie-in/tie-off stitches!
* don't do ties around the fake color change of a "STOP after"
* add a JUMP at the start of each color block
