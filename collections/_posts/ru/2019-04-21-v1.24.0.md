**Changelog:**

Ink/Stitch is now bundled per locale, this removes the need to select the language inside of Inkscape.

Note that Ink/Stitch dialogs themselves are still localized based on your chosen OS language. Your download selection only dictates the languages of the menu items in Inkscape's Extensions menu.
