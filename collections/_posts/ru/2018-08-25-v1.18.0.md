**Changelog:**

* descriptive names for command symbols added by "Attach Commands" et al.
* new commands:
  * stop position
    * the embroidery machine jumps to this point before every Stop command
    * this allows for pushing the embroidery frame out toward the user to make applique steps easier
  * origin
    * specifies the origin (0,0) point for embroidery files
    * NOTE: this replaces the old "guidelines" method of specifying the origin
* translation support for INX files!
  * current languages:
    * German
    * English
* code style standardization
